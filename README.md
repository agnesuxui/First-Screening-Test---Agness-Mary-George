Thank you for taking the time to review my design test submission. Below, I’ve documented my approach, tools used, and some thoughts on the process.

About the Task :

The goal was to recreate three web sections as provided, make them mobile-responsive, and share both designs along with a documented process.

Tools I Used :

Figma — for all design work (desktop & mobile) and asset exports.

Google Fonts — used Manrope as per the brief.

Open-source icons — primarily from svgrepo.

Getting started :

I began by carefully analyzing the original sections to understand the hierarchy, spacing, and visual rhythm.

I set up my Figma file with a 1920 × 1080 px frame for each desktop section.

Designing desktop versions : 

I focused on recreating each section as accurately as possible.

Matched typography sizes and weights using Manrope.

Used open-source icons with a similar style to the originals.

Double-checked spacing and alignments to ensure everything looked clean and balanced.

Creating mobile layouts:

For the mobile version, I used the iPhone 16 Plus frame in Figma as a base (430 px width), since it reflects modern larger screen sizes.

Adjusted heading sizes for better readability on smaller screens.

Stacked elements vertically to create a smoother scroll experience.

Reduced icon sizes and adjusted paddings to avoid crowding.

Made sure buttons and clickable areas are comfortable to tap.

Icon choices

For icons, I wanted to keep a friendly, modern look. I chose icons from open library svgrepo.


This task was really fun to work on! I enjoyed focusing on details like spacing and adapting each section to mobile while keeping the original feel.
Thanks again for reviewing my work! I’m excited to hear your feedback
